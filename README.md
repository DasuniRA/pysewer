## Summary

![Example of an automatically generated Sewer Network](notebooks/example_data/plots/modeldomain_pumps.png)

The aim of pysewer is to provide a framework automatically generate cost-efficient sewer network layouts on minimal data requirements.

It is build around an algorithm for generation of viable sewer-network layouts. The approximated sewer network is represented by sources (households/buildings), potential pathways, and one or multiple sinks. The algorithm approximates the directed steinertree (the steiner arborescence) between all sources and the sink by using an repeated shortest path heuristic (RSPH).

## Installation

Currently the installation is easiest managed via Anaconda. Anaconda 3 can be downloaded [here.](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). The package is tested with **Python 3.10.6**. We recommend using a conda environment to manage the installation of GDAL and other dependencies given the difficulty of installing GDAL using pip. Therefore we urge to first create a new conda environment and install the required packages.  

**Please use conda to install GDAL, it is the easiest way to install GDAL**

### Step 1: Clone the repository and navigate to the root directory

```shell
git clone https://github.com/dbdespot/pysewer.git
cd pysewer
```


### Step 2: Create the conda environment
Here you create a conda environment (pysewer) and install the required packages.  We recommend directly installing GDAL, Rasterio and Fiona using conda.

Creating the conda environment:

```shell
conda create -n pysewer python=3.10.6
```

Activate the environment:

```shell
conda activate pysewer
```

Install the required packages:

```shell
conda install -c conda-forge gdal 
```

All other packages are installed via pip during the installation of pysewer.
Note that the exact versions of the packages used can be found in the [environment.yml](environment.yml) file.  

### Step 3: Install pysewer via pip

Now that you have conda environment uo and running, lets install pysewer. To do this you first need to clone pysewer repository hosted [here.](https://github.com/dbdespot/pysewer) and install it using git and pip with:

```shell
cd pysewer
pip install .
# for the development version
python -m pip install -e .
```

Please see the [documentation](https://despot.pages.ufz.de/pysewer) for more details.

## Input Data and data representation

The following input data is required:

- A Digital Elevation Model (DEM)
- Point Data on Building locations
- Road Network Data

### Preprocessing

The main objective of sewer layout generation is to connect all buildings to a waste water treatment plant (WWTP) while keeping system cost low. The initial graph represents all potential sewer lines in our model domain.

Preprocessing comes down to:

- "connecting" buildings to the street network
- clustering of buildings surpassing a predefined threshold
- contracting the street network for more efficient graph traversal

After preprocessing, all relevant data is and stored as a MultiDiGraph to allow for asymmetric edge values (e.g. elevation profile and subsequently costs).

### Graph Attributes

```yaml
Node Attributes:
    "node_type": "building","wwtp"
    "elevation"
    "pumping_station": bool
    "lifting_station":bool
Edge Attributes:
    "geometry": detailed shapely line
    "length"
    "diameter"
    "pressurized": bool
    "profile"
    "needs_pump": bool
    "private_sewer":bool
    "weight": value representing arbitrary cost function
```

## Routing Solver

![Routing Animation](/notebooks/example_data/plots/rsph.gif)

The package comes with two solvers to find estimates for the underlying steiner tree problem (more specifically minimum steiner arboresence).

- RSPH
- RSPH Fast

---

The _RSPH solver_ iteratively connects the nearest unconnected node (in terms of distance and pump penalty) to the closest connected network node. The solver can account for multiple sinks and is therefore well suited to generate decentralized network scenarios.

The _RSPH Fast_ solver derives the network by combining all shortest paths to a single sink. Faster, but only allows for a single sink.

## Plotting

```python
info = pysewer.get_sewer_info(G)
info["Routing Solver"] = "RSPH"
info["Pump Penalty"] = test_model_domain.pump_penalty
fig,ax = pysewer.plot_model_domain(test_model_domain, plot_sewer=True,sewer_graph = G, info_table=info)
```

```python
pysewer.plot_sewer_attributes(test_model_domain,G,attribute="peak_flow",title="Peak Flow Estimation m³/s")
plt.show()
```

## Export

```python
sewer_network_gdf = pysewer.get_edge_gdf(G,detailed=True)
pysewer.export_sewer_network(sewer_network_gdf, "sewer_network.gpkg")
```

## Default parameters

The default or global parameters are stored in the [settings.yaml](pysewer/config/settings.yaml) file. This file can be overwritten by specifying a custom settings file (e.g.[example_settings.yaml](notebooks/example_settings.yaml)) and passing it to the `load_config(custom_settings.yaml)` function. The settings parameters are categorized into 3 sections, namely `preprocessing`, `optimization` and `plotting`.

The table below summaries the key default parameters and their meaning.
