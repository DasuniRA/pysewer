# Contributing to pysewer

üëçüéâ First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! üéâüëç

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to pysewer and its repositories, which are hosted on GitHub. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [pysewer Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [your email].

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

- **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitLab under [Issues](https://github.com/your/your-project/issues).
  
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/your/your-project/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Suggesting Enhancements

- **Determine [which repository the enhancement should be suggested in](https://git.ufz.de/despot/pysewer_dev/)**.
  
- **Perform a cursory search** to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add to the discussion.

- When you are creating an enhancement suggestion, please **include as many details as possible**.

### Pull Requests

- Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.

- Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality.

- Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

- **Do not introduce breaking changes** unless they are necessary and discussed with the team.

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
  
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...").

- Limit the first line to 72 characters or fewer.

### GitHub Pull Requests and Issues

- Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the suggestion.

- Provide a comprehensive description of the suggested enhancement in as much detail as possible.

- Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps.
