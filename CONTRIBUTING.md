# Contributing to pysewer

üëçüéâ First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! üéâüëç

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to pysewer and its repositories, which are hosted on GitHub. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the pysewer Code of Conduct. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [your email].

How Can I Contribute?

## Reporting Bugs

- Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under Issues.
- If you‚Äôre unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

## Suggesting Enhancements

- Determine which repository the enhancement should be suggested in.
- Perform a cursory search to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add to the discussion.
- When you are creating an enhancement suggestion, please include as many details as possible.

## Forking and Pull Requests

- Fork the Repository: Only maintainers can commit directly to the main branch. All contributions must be made through pull requests from your own fork. Follow these steps to contribute:
  1. Fork the repository on GitHub.
  2. Create a new branch in your fork to isolate the changes.
  3. Submit a pull request (PR) from your fork‚Äôs branch to the main repository‚Äôs develop branch (or another designated branch). Please bear in mind that a PR should be submitted when feature or bug is fixed, the code is tested, documented etc and ready to be merged.
  4. Ensure your branch is up-to-date with the latest version of the develop branch before submitting.
- Permissions and Main Branch: Only maintainers and trusted collaborators have direct commit rights to the main branch to ensure its stability.
- Code Review: All PRs will undergo a code review process by the maintainers before being merged into the main repository.
- Unit Tests: Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality to ensure that your code works as expected. (pytest is preferred)
- No Breaking Changes: Please avoid introducing breaking changes unless absolutely necessary and discussed with the maintainers in advance.
- Automated Testing: Ensure your contribution passes all existing automated tests before submitting a PR.

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense (‚ÄúAdd feature‚Äù not ‚ÄúAdded feature‚Äù).
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or fewer.

### GitHub Pull Requests and Issues

- Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the suggestion.
- Provide a comprehensive description of the suggested enhancement in as much detail as possible.
- Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps.

## Additional Notes

### Issue and Pull Request Labels

This section lists the labels we use to help us track and manage issues and pull requests.

- bug - Issues that are bugs.
- enhancement - Issues that are feature requests.
- discussion - Issues that are discussions.
