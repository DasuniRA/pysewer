    """
    Simplify a graph's topology by removing interstitial nodes.
    Simplify graph topology by removing all nodes that are not intersections
    or dead-ends. Create an edge directly between the end points that
    encapsulate them, but retain the geometry of the original edges, saved as
    an attribute in new edge. Some of the resulting consolidated edges may
    comprise multiple OSM ways, and if so, their multiple attribute values are
    stored as a list.
    Parameters
    ----------
    G : networkx.MultiDiGraph
        input graph
    strict : bool
        if False, allow nodes to be end points even if they fail all other
        rules but have incident edges with different OSM IDs. Lets you keep
        nodes at elbow two-way intersections, but sometimes individual blocks
        have multiple OSM IDs within them too.
    remove_rings : bool
        if True, remove isolated self-contained rings that have no endpoints
